✅ Part 1: Removing a Node from the Cluster

⚠️ Pre-checks before removing a node:

	•	Ensure the node has no active cluster roles (move them to another node).
	•	Ensure quorum will not be lost if the node is removed.
	•	Validate cluster health before making changes.

Step-by-step:
	1.	Open Failover Cluster Manager (FCM)
	•	On any node, open Failover Cluster Manager.
	2.	Connect to Cluster (if not already connected)
	•	Right-click on Failover Cluster Manager, choose “Connect to Cluster”, and select your cluster name.
	3.	Drain Roles (if any are running on the node)
	•	Expand the cluster name → go to Nodes
	•	Right-click on the node to remove → “Pause” > “Drain Roles”
	•	Wait for all roles to move.
	4.	Pause and Evict the Node
	•	Right-click on the node again → “More Actions” > “Evict”
	•	Confirm the eviction.
	5.	Verify Node Removal
	•	The node should disappear from the Nodes section.
	•	Review cluster events and validation to ensure no issues occurred.

✅ Part 2: Adding the Node Back to the Cluster

⚠️ Pre-checks before adding a node:

	•	Ensure the node has:
	•	Same Windows Server OS version and patch level.
	•	Cluster feature installed (Failover-Clustering feature).
	•	Proper DNS resolution and firewall settings.
	•	All necessary storage/network access.
	•	Optional but recommended: Run “Validate Cluster” before adding.

Step-by-step:
	1.	Install Failover Clustering Feature (if not installed)
On the node:

Install-WindowsFeature -Name Failover-Clustering -IncludeManagementTools -Restart

	2.	Open Failover Cluster Manager
	•	On any node that’s already part of the cluster.
	3.	Connect to the Cluster (if not already)
	•	Right-click Failover Cluster Manager, choose “Connect to Cluster”, select your cluster.
	4.	Add Node to Cluster
	•	Right-click Nodes → “Add Node”
	•	Type the hostname of the node you want to add.
	5.	Validation Wizard (Recommended)
	•	It will prompt you to run cluster validation.
	•	Choose Yes and run “Run only tests I select” or “Run all tests” for thorough validation.
	6.	Complete the Wizard
	•	Once validation passes, follow the prompts to add the node.
	7.	Verify Node Addition
	•	Ensure the node appears under Nodes.
	•	Verify it shows as Up and Running.
	•	Optionally Resume the node if it’s paused.
	8.	Test Cluster Role Failover (optional but recommended)
	•	Move a role to the newly added node to verify its functionality.

🛡️ Post Steps & Best Practices
	•	Monitor Event Viewer for cluster-related logs.
	•	Monitor Failover Cluster Manager for health.
	•	Consider resuming cluster-aware backups/monitoring/patching tools on the added node.

✅ Steps to Drain a Node (Without Eviction)

1. Open Failover Cluster Manager
	•	Open Failover Cluster Manager on any cluster node or your management workstation.
	•	Connect to the relevant cluster if not already connected.

2. Navigate to Nodes
	•	Expand the cluster name → Click on Nodes.

3. Pause and Drain the Node
	•	Right-click the node you want to drain.
	•	Select:
“Pause” > “Drain Roles”

This action will:
	•	Move all cluster roles (VMs, file shares, SQL instances, etc.) to other nodes.
	•	Mark the node as Paused, so it won’t receive new workloads until resumed.

4. Verify Roles Were Moved
	•	Go to Roles in the left pane.
	•	Check that all roles are now running on other nodes.

5. (Optional) Perform Maintenance
	•	You can now safely:
	•	Patch the node.
	•	Reboot it.
	•	Perform updates or diagnostics.

✅ Resuming the Node After Maintenance

Once you’re done:

6. Resume the Node
	•	Go back to Nodes, right-click the paused node.
	•	Choose:
“Resume” > “Do Not Fail Roles Back” (recommended to avoid unnecessary failovers)
OR
“Resume” > “Fail Roles Back” (if you want the roles to return to the original node).

✅ Steps to Set Node Priority (Preferred Owners) Using Failover Cluster Manager

1. Open Failover Cluster Manager
	•	Open Failover Cluster Manager.
	•	Connect to your cluster if not already connected.

2. Navigate to Roles
	•	In the left pane, expand your cluster and click on Roles.
	•	You’ll see the list of clustered roles (VMs, file servers, SQL instances, etc.).

3. Right-click the Role You Want to Prioritize
	•	Select Properties.

4. Go to the ‘Preferred Owners’ Tab
	•	In the Properties window, go to the “Preferred Owners” tab.

5. Set Node Priority
	•	You’ll see a list of all cluster nodes.
	•	Check the boxes next to nodes you want to allow as preferred owners.
	•	Reorder them using Move Up / Move Down — the node at the top will have the highest priority.
⚠️ If a role fails, the cluster will try nodes in this order.

6. Apply the Changes
	•	Click OK or Apply to confirm.

✅ PowerShell to Drain a Cluster Node
Suspend-ClusterNode -Name "NodeName" -Drain

This will:
	•	Pause the node (ClusterNode01) in the cluster.
	•	Live migrate all roles (e.g., clustered VMs, SQL instances, etc.) to other nodes.
	•	Prevent any new roles from being moved to that node.

🧠 Check Node Status After Drain
Get-ClusterNode -Name "ClusterNode01" | Format-List Name, State, NodeWeight

✅ PowerShell to Resume the Node (After Maintenance)
Resume-ClusterNode -Name "ClusterNode01" -Failback None

Use -Failback None to resume the node without moving roles back (recommended).
Use -Failback Immediate if you want roles to return to that node immediately.
